# gsd-new-project (Strict Parity)

This Codex skill delegates to the shared GSD runtime command doc.

## Installed runtime locations

- Local: `./.codex/get-shit-done/commands/new-project.md`
- Global: `~/.codex/get-shit-done/commands/new-project.md`

Prefer local if present for the repo you are working in.

## Runbook

1. Open and follow: `~/.codex/get-shit-done/commands/new-project.md` (or the local path).
2. When the runbook references a Claude slash command like `/gsd:...`, use the Codex skill name instead (`gsd-...`).
