# gsd-consider-issues

1. Read `.planning/ISSUES.md`, `.planning/STATE.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`.
2. Re-evaluate each open issue against latest code/project context.
3. Classify each as: do now, schedule later, or close.
4. Update issue statuses and rationale.

Output: triaged issues with explicit decisions.
